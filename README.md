A novel 3D Seq2Seq deep learning respiratory motion simulator (RMSim) that learns from 4D-CT images and predicts future breathing phases given
a static CT image. The predicted respiratory patterns, represented by time-varying displacement vector fields (DVFs) at different breathing phases, are modulated through
auxiliary inputs of 1D breathing traces so that a larger amplitude in the trace results in more significant predicted deformation. Stacked 3D-ConvLSTMs are used to capture
the spatial-temporal respiration patterns. A spatial transformer deforms the static CT with the predicted DVF to generate the predicted phase image. 10-phase 4D-CTs were used to train RMSim. 

## Usage
A pretrained model as well as a set of 20 breathing traces and LUNA public CT dataset can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7730879). Once the data is downloaded, unpack the **pretrained_model.zip** into the **trained_model** folder and unpack **LUNA_imaging.zip** and **LUNA_mask.zip** into the **public_data** folder. Finally, test code can be run using the **test_LUNA.py** script to generate 10 phases, DVF, and the deformed masks. The resuts will be generated in the results folder. The final results from the test run can also be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7730879).
